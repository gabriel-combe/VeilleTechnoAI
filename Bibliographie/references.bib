	abstract = {This paper presents ”One Spell Fits All”, an {AI}-native game prototype where the player, playing as a witch, solves villagers’ problems using magical conjurations. We show how, beyond being a standalone game, ”One Spell Fits All” could serve as a research platform to explore several key areas in {AI}-driven and {AI}-native game design. These areas include {AI} creativity, user experience in predominantly {AI}-generated content, and the energy efficiency of locally running versus cloud-based {AI} models. By leveraging smaller, locally running generative {AI} models, including {LLMs} and diffusion models for image generation, the game dynamically generates and evaluates content without the need for external {APIs} or internet access, offering a sustainable and responsive gameplay experience. This paper explores the application of {LLMs} in narrative video games, outlines a game prototype’s design and mechanics, and proposes future research opportunities that can be explored using the game as a platform.},

	abstract = {The evolution of game development has transitioned from manual coding (Software 1.0) to data-driven Artificial Intelligence ({AI}) (Software 2.0), and now to a more advanced stage—video game development 3.0. This phase is characterized by {AI}-driven processes leveraging large language models ({LLMs}), neural networks, and other {AI} techniques that autonomously generate code, content, and narratives. This paper explores the foundational technologies underpinning this paradigm shift, including customizable {AI} modules, dynamic asset creation, and intelligent non player characters ({NPCs}) that adapt to player interactions. It also highlights the integration of {AI} with emerging technologies like Virtual Reality ({VR}), Augmented Reality ({AR}), and brain-computer interfaces, which are set to further enhance player immersion. Through case studies of {AI}-driven procedural world creation in No Man’s Sky, dynamic narrative generation in {RPGs} like Cyberpunk 2077, and {AI}-assisted esports balancing in League of Legends, the study demonstrates the transformative potential of {AI} in creating more scalable, adaptive, and personalized game experiences. However, the paper also addresses challenges, such as balancing technical assistance with human creativity and ensuring ethical practices in {AI}-driven content. Ultimately, this study envisions a future where {AI} democratizes game development, empowering both indie developers and large studios to create more innovative and inclusive games. The conclusion calls for collaboration among developers, researchers, and players to fully realize the potential of the new generative framework, emphasizing the need for continuous exploration and refinement of {AI} tools in gaming.},

At the same time, video games have become the so-called "ninth art" after painting, architecture and other art categories. In the field of video games, players' requirements for game experience are constantly increasing, and they expect games to provide a richer and more immersive experience. The development of generative artificial intelligence provides new ideas for the game field. Developers can use {AI} for innovative experiments, explore new game mechanisms and gameplay, and open up infinite possibilities for game design, content creation, and the way players interact. This paper studies the application of generative artificial intelligence in electronic games. It first investigates the current development needs of games and the existing condition of generative artificial intelligence at the current time.

	abstract = {Large language models ({LLMs}) offer unprecedented flexibility in procedural generation, enabling the creation of dynamic video game storylines that evolve with user input. A critical aspect of realizing this potential is allowing players and developers to provide dynamic or free-form text to drive generation. Ingesting free-form text for a video game poses challenges, however, as it can prompt the {LLM} to generate content beyond the intended narrative scope. In response to this challenge, this research introduces Procedural Artificial Narrative using Generative {AI} ({PANGeA}) for leveraging {LLMs} to create narrative content for turn-based, role-playing games ({RPGs}). {PANGeA} is an approach comprised of components including a memory system, validation system, a Unity game engine plug-in, and a server with a {RESTful} interface that enables connecting {PANGeA} components with any game engine as well as accessing local and private {LLMs}. {PANGeA} procedurally generates level data like setting, key items, non-playable characters ({NPCs})), and dialogue based on a set of configuration and design rules provided by the game designer. This process is supported by a novel validation system for handling free-form text input during game development and gameplay, which aligns {LLM} generation with the narrative. It does this by evoking the {LLM}'s capabilities to dynamically evaluate the text input against game rules that reinforce the designer's initial criteria. To enrich player-{NPC} interactions, {PANGeA} uses the Big Five Personality model to shape {NPC} responses. To explore its broad application, {PANGeA} is evaluated across two studies. First, this research presents a narrative test scenario of the prototype game, Dark Shadows, which was developed using {PANGeA} within the Unity game engine. This is followed by an ablation study that tests {PANGeA}'s performance across 10 different role-playing game scenarios–from western to science fiction–and across three model sizes: Llama-3 (8B), {GPT}-3.5, and {GPT}-4. These evaluations demonstrate that {PANGeA}'s {NPCs} can hold dynamic, narrative-consistent conversations that, without the memory system, would exceed the {LLM}'s context length. In addition, the results demonstrate {PANGeA}'s validation system not only aligns {LLM} responses with the game narrative but also improves the performance of Llama-3 (8B), enabling it to perform comparably to large-scale foundational models like {GPT}-4. With the validation system, Llama-3 (8B)'s performance improved from 28\% accuracy to 98\%, and {GPT}-4's from 71\% to 99\%. These findings indicate {PANGeA} can help game designers generate narrative-consistent content while leveraging {LLMs} of different sizes, suitable for various devices.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence ({AI}) has enabled agents to master complex video games, from first-person shooters like Counter-Strike to real-time strategy games such as {StarCraft} {II} and racing games like Gran Turismo. While these achievements are notable, applying these {AI} methods in commercial video game production remains challenging due to computational constraints. In commercial scenarios, the majority of computational resources are allocated to 3D rendering, leaving limited capacity for {AI} methods, which often demand high computational power, particularly those relying on pixel-based sensors. Moreover, the gaming industry prioritizes creating human-like behavior in {AI} agents to enhance player experience, unlike academic models that focus on maximizing game performance. This paper introduces a novel methodology for training neural networks via imitation learning to play a complex, commercial-standard, {VALORANT}-like 2v2 tactical shooter game, requiring only modest {CPU} hardware during inference. Our approach leverages an innovative, pixelfree perception architecture using a small set of ray-cast sensors, which capture essential spatial information efficiently. These sensors allow {AI} to perform competently without the computational overhead of traditional methods. Models are trained to mimic human behavior using supervised learning on human trajectory data, resulting in realistic and engaging {AI} agents. Human evaluation tests confirm that our {AI} agents provide human-like gameplay experiences while operating efficiently under computational constraints. This offers a significant advancement in {AI} model development for tactical shooter games and possibly other genres.},

As technology advances, video games increasingly demand high computing power, often requiring specialized hardware for optimal performance. Realtime strategy games, in particular, are computationally intensive, with complex artificial intelligence algorithms that simulate numerous units and behaviors in real-time. Specialized gaming {PCs} are used to run these games, which have a dedicated {GPU}. Due to the usefulness of {GPUs} besides gaming, modern processors usually include an integrated {GPU}, specially in the laptop market. We propose a hybrid architecture that utilizes both the dedicated {GPU} and the integrated {GPU} simultaneously, to accelerate {AI} and physics simulations in video games. The hybrid approach aims to maximize the utilization of all available resources. The {AI} and physics computations are offloaded from the dedicated {GPU} to the integrated {GPU}. Therefore, the dedicated {GPU} can be used exclusively for rendering, resulting in improved performance. We implemented this architecture in a custom-built game engine using {OpenGL} for graphics rendering and {OpenCL} for generalpurpose {GPU} computations. Experimental results highlight the performance characteristics of the hybrid architecture, including the challenges of working with the two devices and multi-tenant {GPU} interference.},

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence ({AI}) technologies, which have started to be used in almost all areas of life, are now also used in games. Especially for bot systems that play the game automatically in many popular video games recently, it has become possible for these bots to defeat the grandmasters of the game with advanced Deep Learning ({DL}) methods. The purpose of this study is to develop an {AI}-based two-dimensional video game in Unity 2D Game Engine, which can decide what the game characters will do within their abilities. In the game application, the two-dimensional game character is controlled by the user. This character moves in a two-dimensional game plane that is created using procedural plane generation algorithms. In addition, statistics such as the number of enemies defeated and the level reached in the game are recorded. The game is based on the Unity2D game engine and is written in C\#. In the study, 8 different experiments are performed. In these experiments, the player's success time in the game with different equipment defined for the character is measured. This time ranges from 0.54 seconds to 1.88 seconds. Today, {AI} algorithms are developed to play computer games better or to design better games, and new games are designed to improve {AI} algorithms. In this context, it is evaluated that this study will contribute to the literature on the use of {AI} in computer games.

Inspired by James P. Carse’s distinction between finite and infinite games (Carse, 1986), we leverage recent advances in generative {AI} to create {UNBOUNDED}: a game of character life simulation that is fully encapsulated in generative models. Specifically, {UNBOUNDED} draws inspiration from sandbox life simulations and allows you to interact with your autonomous virtual character in a virtual world by feeding, playing with and guiding it - with open-ended mechanics generated by an {LLM}, some of which can be emergent. In order to develop {UNBOUNDED}, we propose technical innovations in both the {LLM} and visual generation domains. Specifically, we present: (1) a specialized, distilled large language model ({LLM}) that dynamically generates game mechanics, narratives, and character interactions in real-time, and (2) a new dynamic regional image prompt Adapter ({IP}-Adapter) for vision models that ensures consistent yet flexible visual generation of a character across multiple environments. We evaluate our system through both qualitative and quantitative analysis, showing significant improvements in character life simulation, user instruction following, narrative coherence, and visual consistency for both characters and the environments compared to traditional related approaches.},

	title = {Towards Grounded Dialogue Generation in Video Game Environments},
	abstract = {Video games provide rich interactive environments that have proven to be great testbeds for {AI} research in areas such as grounded language generation and reinforcement learning. In this preliminary work, we show that commercial video games can also be an excellent resource for interactive storytelling. We introduce a dataset extracted from the widely acclaimed computer role-playing game Disco Elysium: The Final Cut. With roughly 1.1M words of dialogue spread across a complex graph of possible utterances, the game provides a strong research foundation for interactive storytelling. Furthermore, nodes in the dialogue graph can express conditional logic that permanently alter the game state, and thus affects reachability in the graph. These conditions are encoded in the form of Lua scripts written by the game’s designers. To demonstrate the utility of the dataset, we cluster dialogue based on similarity and linearize all possible utterances for the next turn of dialogue into a Lua script containing a mix of natural language and game logic. We then mask out one utterance from the script and use a large language model to generate a plausible alternative. Analyses of these generations demonstrate the difficulty of this task and suggest future avenues for research, which if successful, have the potential to profoundly impact dialogue writing in video games.},

Among them, the non-player characters in the game, namely {NPC}, are part of the applications of {AI}. The virtual characters in the game characters are collectively called {NPC}, which enhances the fidelity and complexity of the game by having contact with with the players. Using {AI} can make {NPCs} in the game more vivid, thereby increasing the playability of the game and creating more possibilities.

	title = {Affective Dialogue Generation for Video Games},
	abstract = {Affective text generation has been a topic of interest within the Natural Language Processing community and has been left scarcely explored within the context of the gaming industry. With this project, we aimed to bring the paradigm of affective text generation into video games. This was done by developing a generative language model that generates affective dialogue for the video game Fallout 4, comparing the generated text to human-written one and measuring how accurate it is at exhibiting the correct emotion. To do this we have selected, extracted and pre-processed the Fallout 4 dialogue dataset, then fine-tuned the Generative Pre-trained Transformer ({GPT}) 2 language model on the prepared data. Afterward, we have implemented the affective extension which incorporates affect into dialogue generation. Using the fine-tuned {GPT}-2 model together with the Affective Extension and Top-K sampling method, we developed a generation pipeline that generates affective dialogue for Fallout 4 given any in-game prompt string. Then, a human evaluation was performed to compare the responses generated by the model to human-written responses on metrics - Coherence, Relevance, Fittingness and Human-likeness - and to measure how accurate the responses are in exhibiting a given target affect. The results of the survey suggest that the model-generated responses compares poorly to human-written ones on all of the metrics and the responses generated by the model exhibit affects unsuccessfully.},
